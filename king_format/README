==========
KingFormate consists of two different formatting helper regions:

== Model
Define fields as type date, money or percent.  When the fields are shown in the
views, their format is detected and the output is looking nice.

== View & Helper
Output any model value through the function formatted_value to ensure a consistent output.

There are select values for money-symbols and date formatting.
